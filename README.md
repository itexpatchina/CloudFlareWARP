# WARP VPN Usage Guide in Mainland China

This document provides a practical overview of how to use Cloudflare‚Äôs free VPN services ‚Äî WARP and 1.1.1.1 ‚Äî while operating within mainland China.

## Current Status of the WARP App in China

As of 2025, Cloudflare‚Äôs WARP and 1.1.1.1 apps generally do **not** function reliably behind China‚Äôs Great Firewall (GFW). In contrast, throughout much of 2023, the apps operated smoothly across iPhones, Android devices, and PCs.

While it‚Äôs still possible to download and install the apps ‚Äî assuming access to a non-China Apple ID or Google Play Store ‚Äî successfully establishing a WARP connection has become increasingly rare, if not impossible.

Many Chinese tech YouTubers suspect that Cloudflare‚Äôs ingress IPs have been blacklisted by the GFW, and this theory holds weight. Cloudflare openly publishes its WARP ingress IP list here:  üîó [Cloudflare WARP Ingress IPs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/firewall/#warp-ingress-ip)

### WireGuard Protocol IP Ranges (Quoted from Cloudflare on 2025-07-13)

- **IPv4 Range**: `162.159.193.0/24`  
- **IPv6 Range**: `2606:4700:100::/48`  
- **Default Port**: `UDP 2408`  
- **Fallback Ports**:  
  - `UDP 500`  
  - `UDP 1701`  
  - `UDP 4500`

## WireGuard Configuration via Telegram Bot

Since Cloudflare's WARP is fundamentally a WireGuard-based solution, it‚Äôs possible to either extract an existing configuration or create a new one ‚Äî provided it adheres to Cloudflare‚Äôs standard settings.

One of the most convenient tools I use personally is the following Telegram bot:

<img width="335" height="442" alt="Telegram Bot Interface" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/789096c1-7ee5-48c2-8995-a9962e4c7e71" />

Simply send the `/generate` command to this bot, and you‚Äôll receive a `wg-config.conf` file ‚Äî a valid WireGuard configuration that can be imported into the standard WireGuard app (iOS, Android, or Windows).

## Limitations of WireGuard Config Inside China

Below is a sample `wg-config.conf` file generated via the Telegram bot (sensitive keys truncated for privacy):

<img width="412" height="175" alt="Sample WireGuard Configuration" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85de15ed-373f-4fa6-a220-8a40833430e5" />

While this configuration may appear valid, it typically **will not work inside mainland China** due to how DNS resolution interacts with the Great Firewall (GFW). Specifically:

- The endpoint `engage.cloudflareclient.com:2408` often resolves to a Cloudflare ingress IP close to the user‚Äôs geographic location.
- These localized IPs are highly likely to be blacklisted by GFW, resulting in failed connections.
- This same behavior occurs when using the WARP app directly ‚Äî tapping the "Connect" button simply attempts to resolve and connect to one of those inaccessible ingress IPs.

Therefore, while the bot-generated config file might work in less restricted regions, additional measures are needed for stable connectivity within China.

## Searching for Viable Endpoints

While the default endpoint `engage.cloudflareclient.com:2408` often fails inside mainland China, several Cloudflare ingress IPs (previously listed) may still be accessible.

Chinese tech YouTuber **yonggekkk** shares a helpful set of scripts on GitHub that can scan and identify working endpoint IP‚Äìport pairs.

## Using Viable Endpoints in WireGuard

In the previous step, the test script outputs a `result.csv` file containing viable IPv4 endpoint addresses. You can choose one of the working IP‚Äìport pairs to replace the default Cloudflare endpoint `engage.cloudflareclient.com:2408` in your `wg-config.conf` file.

For instance, if `162.159.192.86:1387` is confirmed as functional, simply update the endpoint line: Endpoint = 162.159.192.86:1387

## WireGuard Connection Demo on Windows 11

I'm currently demonstrating WireGuard on a Windows 11 PC:

Once you click the **Activate** button, the connection will likely succeed. The WireGuard transfer panel will display live traffic stats like:

> `XX KiB received, YY KiB sent`

### Connection Verification

- A ping to Google confirms network access:

- According to [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com), the detected IPv4 address still points to mainland China ‚Äî typically in a Cloudflare datacenter (e.g. Shanghai):

### Access Limitations

Despite a working WireGuard tunnel:

- Major AI platforms remain inaccessible:

- Geo-restricted streaming services like Netflix also fail:

### Accessible Services

Fortunately, websites typically blocked in mainland China ‚Äî such as Google, Facebook, YouTube, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram ‚Äî become available again with reasonable connection speeds:

## Conclusion

Cloudflare WARP, while built on the robust WireGuard protocol, faces significant connectivity challenges within mainland China due to GFW interference. However, with the help of community tools and endpoint scanning scripts, it's still possible to create functional configurations using manually selected IP‚Äìport pairs. Although access to geo-restricted services like Netflix and AI platforms remains limited, the workaround enables reliable access to essential global sites such as Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. This guide provides a hands-on walkthrough‚Äîfrom configuration generation to live testing‚Äîand offers practical insights for users seeking partial but meaningful restoration of open internet access.
